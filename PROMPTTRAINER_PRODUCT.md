# PromptTrainer Product Specification

## 1. Vision & Positioning
**Javlin** is an AI‐driven training platform that helps aspiring prompt engineers and AI‐evaluator candidates master real‐world ranking and feedback exercises through guided practice and instant coaching.

## 2. Problem Statement
- **Unprepared candidates:** Thousands apply to AI evaluator jobs without targeted, hands‐on practice.
- **Lack of interactive training:** Existing resources are static guides or forums—no drill‐based environment.
- **Unclear standards:** Applicants don’t know what differentiates a “3/5” from a “5/5” evaluation.

## 3. Target Personas
1. **Career‐Changer**  
   - Wants a fast, guided way to prep for evaluator tests.  
   - Needs bite‐sized drills with clear feedback.

2. **Prompt Engineer**  
   - Seeks to benchmark and sharpen prompt‐ranking skills.  
   - Values measurable progress and credentials.

3. **L&D Manager**  
   - Needs an on‐demand training tool to certify evaluator contractors.  
   - Values analytics and group‐management features.

## 4. Core User Stories
1. As a **user**, I want to rank a set of AI responses (1–5) so I can practice test conditions.  
2. As a **user**, I want to see an AI‐generated 5/5 exemplar and rationale so I understand scoring criteria.  
3. As a **user**, I want to rewrite a low‐scoring response and get AI critique so I learn to craft better outputs.  
4. As a **user**, I want to view my streak and score history on a dashboard so I stay motivated.  
5. As an **admin**, I want to upload new prompt‐response sets so content stays fresh.  
6. As a **user**, I want to pause/resume my streak in case of travel or time off.  
7. As a **user**, I want in‐UI help definitions (e.g. “What makes a 3/5?”) so I’m never confused.
